## Project goals
**Context:** A new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean has been found. 
The organism freshly named *Pila aequor (P. aequor)* has only 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates make *P. aequor* an interesting specimen to study. However, *P.* aequor cannot survive above sea level. **The project goal** is to create objects that simulate the DNA of *P. aequor* for your research team to study.
